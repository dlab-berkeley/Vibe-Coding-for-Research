## Workshop Goals

This hands-on workshop will teach you how to leverage AI for research computing through natural language interaction, with practical demonstrations, real research examples, and comprehensive resource guides. You will learn to navigate the landscape of AI research tools from ChatGPT's Code Interpreter to specialized platforms like Perplexity for citations, understand the progression from simple chatbots to autonomous research agents, and discover how to build custom research tools without traditional programming. We'll explore both web-based interfaces and advanced coding environments, demonstrate multi-agent systems for complex research tasks, and address critical considerations including validation, testing, tokenization, and cost management. Participants will leave with a clear framework for choosing appropriate AI tools and practical strategies for integrating AI-powered coding into their research workflow.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this workshop, you will be able to:

* **Navigate and select appropriate AI research tools,** understanding the strengths of platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity, and choosing between web interfaces, coding assistants, and autonomous agents based on your research needs.
* **Use Perplexity and other AI tools for literature review,** generating properly cited academic sources, synthesizing research findings, and maintaining scholarly standards while leveraging AI for efficient literature discovery.
* **Direct AI to generate and validate research code** through effective prompting, translating complex statistical analyses and data processing needs into natural language instructions that produce working, reproducible code.
* **Build and orchestrate research agents,** including creating specialized subagents for tasks like data cleaning, statistical analysis, and paper drafting, understanding how to combine multiple AI systems for complex research workflows.
* **Implement validation and testing strategies** for AI-generated code, using cross-validation with multiple models, testing on known datasets, and ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of your computational research.
* **Understand tokenization and manage AI costs effectively,** calculating token usage for your research tasks, optimizing prompts to minimize costs, and developing a sustainable budget strategy for long-term AI tool usage in your research.

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance
data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to
provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to
use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels
and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary.
We offer these services in the form of workshops, one-to-one consulting, and
working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and
programming languages.
